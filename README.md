# Project-2-Exploring-Hacker-News-Posts

We are going to analyze what is the feedback for two types of HN posts (Ask and show). And see which one is more popular (we are going to take comments average as our metric). You can find the dataset here:https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

We'll specifically compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
It should be noted that the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
